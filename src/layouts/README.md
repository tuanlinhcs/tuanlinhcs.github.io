# layouts
The first new folder is the ***layouts*** folder and this one is really simple. This is just a special folder for placing any layout based components. This would be things like a sidebar, navbar, container, etc. If you application only has a handful of layouts then this folder really isn't needed and you can just place the layout components in the ***components*** folder, but if you have multiple different layouts used across your application this is a great place to store them.
