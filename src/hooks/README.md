# hooks

## Simple Folder Structure

The hooks folder contains every single custom hook in your entire project. This is a useful folder to have in any size project since almost every project will have multiple custom hooks so having a single place to put them all is really useful.

## Intermediate Folder Structure

The final folder that is a repeat from the simple folder structure is the hooks folder. This folder is pretty much identical to the previous hooks folder, but instead of storing every hook in your application it will only store the global hooks that are used across multiple pages. This is because all page specific hooks are stored in the pages folder.
