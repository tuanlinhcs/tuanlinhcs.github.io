# components

## Simple Folder Structure

The components folder in the simple folder structure is incredibly straightforward since it will contain every single component in your entire application. Now obviously as your project grows beyond 10-15 components this folder can become incredibly unruly to deal with which is why in all other folder structures our components are spread across multiple folders and given more structure. For small projects, though, this added complexity is not needed and a single folder is just fine.

## Intermediate Folder Structure

Another big change you will notice with this example is that our components folder is further broken down into subfolders. These subfolders are really useful since they help keep your components organized into different sections instead of just being one massive blob of components. In our example we have a ui folder which contains all our UI components like buttons, modals, cards, etc. We also have a form folder for form specific controls like checkboxes, inputs, date pickers, etc.

You can customize and breakdown this components folder however you see fit based on your project needs, but ideally this folder shouldn't get too large as many of your more complex components will be stored in the pages folder.
