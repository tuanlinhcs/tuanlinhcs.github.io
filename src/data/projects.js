      "Using Python, Selenium, and the Telegram API, I built a bot that automatically collects the latest items posted on Nextdoor and sends them as a message to a designated Telegram account. This project allowed me to apply my programming skills and utilize web automation techniques to create a practical and useful tool for monitoring activity on Nextdoor. With the bot's ability to continuously track and report new items, users can stay informed and never miss an update. Overall, this project was a challenging and rewarding experience that further developed my expertise in Python, web automation, and API integration.",

      "While studying Machine Learning at university, I built a system that detects faces, trains a model, and recognizes people in images, videos, and camera feeds. By applying my theoretical knowledge and programming skills, I created a practical and useful tool for security, surveillance, and identification purposes. The system can differentiate between individuals, achieving high accuracy through the implementation of various image processing techniques and training with large datasets. This project was a challenging but rewarding experience that allowed me to put my skills into practice and learn new techniques for face detection and recognition, developing my expertise in the field of Machine Learning.",
